- A custom pentest VM within their internal network that calls back to our jump host, and we can SSH into it to perform testing.
- They've also given us a Windows host that we can load tools onto if need be.
- They've asked us to start from an unauthenticated standpoint but have also given us a standard domain user account (`htb-student`) which can be used to access the Windows attack host.
- "Grey box" testing. They have given us the network range 172.16.5.0/23 and no other information about the network.
- Non-evasive testing.
