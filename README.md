Welcome to my cybersecurity learning repository! This is a collection of notes, resources, and insights Iâ€™ve gathered throughout my journey. Whether you're a fellow learner, a professional, or just curious about the realm of cybersecurity, I hope you find value here.

- `Security_notes.ctb` Was my first step at notes taking process which I started with [cherrytree](#https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/)
- Now I'm only using obsidian and I'm workin on rewriting the cherryTree file to become markdown.
- I'm using a Python script that processes Markdown files to convert wiki-style links to standard Markdown links so that the obsidian md files become github friendly.
