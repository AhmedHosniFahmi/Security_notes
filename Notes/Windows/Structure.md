#### Important Directories on the OS Directory

| Name:               | Location:                            | Description:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| %SYSTEMROOT%\Temp   | `C:\Windows\Temp`                    | Global directory containing temporary system files accessible to all users on the system. All users, regardless of authority, are provided full read, write, and execute permissions in this directory. Useful for dropping files as a low-privilege user on the system.         |
| %TEMP%              | `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Temp` | Local directory containing a user's temporary files accessible only to the user account that it is attached to. Provides full ownership to the user that owns this folder. Useful when the attacker gains control of a local/domain joined user account.                         |
| %PUBLIC%            | `C:\Users\Public`                    | Publicly accessible directory allowing any interactive logon account full access to read, write, modify, execute, etc., files and subfolders within the directory. Alternative to the global Windows Temp Directory as it's less likely to be monitored for suspicious activity. |
| %ProgramFiles%      | `C:\Program Files`                   | folder containing all 64-bit applications installed on the system. Useful for seeing what kind of applications are installed on the target system.                                                                                                                               |
| %ProgramFiles(x86)% | `C:\Program Files (x86)`             | Folder containing all 32-bit applications installed on the system. Useful for seeing what kind of applications are installed on the target system.                                                                                                                               |

| `%SYSTEMROOT%`        | Expands to `C:\Windows`. A system-defined read-only variable containing the Windows system folder. Anything Windows considers important to its core functionality is found here, including important data, core system binaries, and configuration files.                                 |
| `%LOGONSERVER%`       | Provides us with the login server for the currently active user followed by the machine's hostname. We can use this information to know if a machine is joined to a domain or workgroup.                                                                                                  |

| `%ProgramFiles%`      | Equivalent of `C:\Program Files`. This location is where all the programs are installed on an `x64` based system.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `%ProgramFiles(x86)%` | Equivalent of `C:\Program Files (x86)`. This location is where all 32-bit programs running under `WOW64` are installed. Note that this variable is only accessible on a 64-bit host. It can be used to indicate what kind of host we are interacting with. (`x86` vs. `x64` architecture) |
